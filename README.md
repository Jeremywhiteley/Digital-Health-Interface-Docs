#Helpful Digital Health Interface/EDI Documents#

It seems like every time I start a new digital health project, I'm always digging up a bunch of documentation about various interfaces and standards to re-acquaint myself with things.

So, I do the usual thing:

1. Go to the HL7 website.
2. Try to find the things that aren't paywalled and helpful.
3. Quit.
4. Go to google.
5. Start hen-pecking through quoted google terms.
6. Finally find a seemingly useful document.
7. Read it once, determine if it's actually up-to-date or not. It's probably not up-to-date. Repeat 6 as needed.
8. It sits in my downloads folder.
9. I get a new computer or I forget about the file names.
10. Go back to step 1.

This is an attempt for me to keep interesting digital health interface documents across projects and to share this with other people that might find it helpful. I'd also like to crowdsource this knowledge to make this easier for first time digital health programmers.

If you submit a pull request, I'll definitely add your documents or exclude old documents in after a quick review.

I have written none of the documents located here, but found them online. The ownership of said documents belongs to their original owners, so provide attribution as necessary.
